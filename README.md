# Counter App

The **Counter App** is a simple yet functional web application built using **React.js**. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. The app has a minimalist user interface, providing a clean and intuitive user experience, and is fully responsive to work seamlessly across devices.

This project demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as **state management using hooks**, **component-based structure**, and **event handling**. It's designed to be easily expandable for additional features, making it a great starting point for learning or building more complex applications.

**Key Features:**

- **Increment & Decrement:** Users can increase or decrease the counter by clicking respective buttons.
  
- **Reset Functionality:** The counter can be reset to its initial state at any time.

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

- **State Management:** Utilizes React hooks (`useState`) to manage and update the counterâ€™s value dynamically.

- **Component-Based Structure:** Each part of the app is divided into reusable components, promoting a modular design.
