The **Counter App** is a simple web application built using **React.js** that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. It features a minimalist user interface and is fully responsive. The app demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as state management using hooks, component-based structure, and event handling. To run the app locally, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and start the development server using `npm start`. The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default and is structured to be easily expandable for additional features.
